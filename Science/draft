BASICS

Before we begin, we will have a look at some basic definations that will help us in understanding the following concepts.

1.) Polynomial Sequence - A sequence of polynomials , for i = 0, 1, 2, ..., where  is exactly of degree i for all i.
Alternative Defination -  A sequence of polynomials indexed by the nonnegative integers 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., in which each index is equal to the degree of the corresponding polynomial.

2.) Second-order linear differential equation - A second order differential equation is an equation involving the unknown function y, its derivatives y' and y'', and the variable x. 






























 1.) LAGUERRE POLYNOMIAL

Laguerre's equation: xy’’ + (1-x)y’ + ny = 0  (which is a second-order linear differential equation). 
	Laguerre polynomials are solution to Laguerre’s equation.
	This equation has nonsingular solutions only if n is a non-negative integer.




Defination :  






First few Laguerre polynomials are as given in the table below:
















Their graphs are as shown below:




Also,
	One can also define the Laguerre polynomials recursively, defining the first two polynomials as
	L(0)(x) = 1
	L(1)(x) = 1-x
Generating Function:


Using Recurrance Relation : 
	The recurrance relation for any k>=1 can be given as:



The closed form is:





Extending it to Generality:
	More generally, the name Laguerre polynomials is used for solutions of xy’’ + (α+1-x)y’ 	+ ny = 0 , for any arbitary real α.
